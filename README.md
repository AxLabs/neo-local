## What?

Quickly fire up a personal NEO blockchain which you can use to run tests, 
execute commands, and inspect state while controlling how the chain operates.

This project quickly sets this up for you without any prior knowledge needed, 
along with a number of other utility 
[services](https://github.com/CityOfZion/neo-local/wiki#services) that help with 
development.

This project works on MacOS, Linux and Windows machines üëç

It shares similar goals to the [Ganache](https://truffleframework.com/ganache) 
project from the [Truffle Framework](https://truffleframework.com/ganache).
